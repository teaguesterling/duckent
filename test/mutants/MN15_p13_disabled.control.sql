-- THIS IS THE CONTROL: the same copy with NO planted edit, so applying it is a no-op
-- CREATE OR REPLACE of the macro the mutant copies. test/run_mutants.py --verify applies
-- it and requires the mutant's expect_fail suites to PASS, which is what makes the kill
-- evidence about the EDIT rather than about the copy having drifted from the source.
-- vvv GENERATED BELOW by test/mutants/regen.py from sql/04_dml.sql -- do not edit by hand vvv
-- Regenerate with: python3 test/mutants/regen.py   (--check verifies, writes nothing)
-- P13: within each ROOT partition, the first row is level 0 and no row descends more than one level.
-- Returns a statement that raises when violated. MN15 mutates tree_sql_p13_pred.
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO tree_sql_p13_pred() AS 'd > 1 OR (rn = 1 AND _level <> 0)';
