-- THIS IS THE CONTROL: the same copy with NO planted edit, so applying it is a no-op
-- CREATE OR REPLACE of the macro the mutant copies. test/run_mutants.py --verify applies
-- it and requires the mutant's expect_fail suites to PASS, which is what makes the kill
-- evidence about the EDIT rather than about the copy having drifted from the source.
-- vvv GENERATED BELOW by test/mutants/regen.py from sql/07_match.sql -- do not edit by hand vvv
-- Regenerate with: python3 test/mutants/regen.py   (--check verifies, writes nothing)
-- Clause predicate on the step alias, which is passed in: a placeholder substituted afterwards
-- would rewrite any user text that happened to contain it. Attribute and pseudo filters are
-- NULL-definite. p is the projection relation text and elem the tree's ELEMENT flag, both only
-- for the positional built-ins. MN19 mutates the where branch.
